The Smarted Frontend is a robust web application built with React, Redux, and Material-UI (MUI). It serves as a comprehensive solution for managing classes from 1 to 10 in a school, providing distinct levels of access for administrators, teachers, and students.

The Smarted Frontend includes the following features:

1. **Role-based Access Control:** The dashboard supports three roles: student, teacher, and admin. Each role has specific permissions and access levels within the system.

3. **Teacher Management:** Administrators have the ability to manage teacher profiles, including adding, modifying, and removing teachers from the system.

4. **Course Management:** The dashboard enables administrators to manage whole academic data of the institution. They can create and assign teachers for various classes and teachers can enroll students and manage course materials, assignments, projects,library dues and grades etc.
